/**
 * Handoff for a deep link that has to survive a route change (#733).
 *
 * The Pro shell owns a single route (`/pro`) and renders each surface inside a
 * tab, so a permalink like `/mail/message/<id>` can't reach the surface as a
 * route param: ProInterfaceRedirect intercepts it and replaces the URL. It
 * parks the segments here, opens the right tab, and the surface picks them up
 * on mount - exactly like `protocol-handlers/session` does for `mailto:`.
 *
 * Some links carry a query-string half too (`?account=` for calendar events,
 * `?preview=` for files). Under `/pro` the address bar has no search string
 * left by the time the surface parses the link, so it travels with the parked
 * entry instead of being read back from `window.location`.
 *
 * Surfaces in the Pro shell stay mounted for the whole session, so a link that
 * arrives *while the shell is already running* (an in-app link to
 * `/settings/folders`, a `mailto:`-style handoff, ...) would be parked and
 * never seen - the mount-time consume has long since run. For that case a
 * mounted surface subscribes here: when a listener exists, `setPendingDeepLink`
 * delivers the segments to it directly instead of parking them.
 *
 * Module state, deliberately: it must not survive a reload (the URL is gone by
 * then, so re-applying it would reopen something the user already closed).

/**
 * Which timestamp to show for a message.
 *
 * JMAP `receivedAt` is the server's internal date - the moment the message
 * landed in the store. That is fine for freshly delivered mail, but it is not
 * the mail's own date: an import, migration or backup restore that does not
 * preserve internal dates stamps every message with the import time, so a whole
 * mailbox suddenly "arrived" today (#891). `sentAt` is the RFC 5322 `Date`
 * header, which survives such moves and is what Thunderbird, Outlook and Apple
 * Mail display.
 *
 * Prefer `sentAt`; fall back to `receivedAt` when the header is missing,
 * unparsable, or implausibly far in the future relative to the receive time
 * (spam forges future dates to float to the top of date-sorted lists; genuine
 * clock skew is minutes, not days).
 *
 * List *ordering* is unaffected - queries still sort by `receivedAt`, which is
 * monotonic and cannot be forged by the sender.

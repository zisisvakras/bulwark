### Security

- **Calendar / Auth**: Pin the resolved IP address at socket-connect time when fetching caller-supplied URLs (iCalendar subscriptions, JMAP login and TOTP token-exchange servers). The public-host check used to run before `fetch()` opened its socket, so an attacker who controlled DNS for a hostname could rebind it to loopback, RFC-1918 or cloud-metadata addresses between the check and the connect and read up to 10 MB of the internal response through the unauthenticated `/api/fetch-ical` endpoint. Redirect targets are now validated the same way (GHSA-24w9-8r42-8jwm, thanks @Tike00)

### Features

- **Push**: Re-sync existing push registrations in the background on app start, so registrations created before the delivery filter existed — or whose Junk mailbox id went stale — get repaired without re-enabling notifications

### Fixes

- **Push**: Stop sending notifications for spam — the push subscription now carries a JMAP `emailPush` delivery filter that excludes `$junk` and the Junk mailbox (needs a server advertising the `emailPush` capability, e.g. Stalwart ≥ 0.16.16; older servers keep the previous behaviour)

### Fixes

- **Navigation**: Forward every request header through the proxy — Next 16.3's RSC header check rejected the stripped router headers and sent navigations into a 307 redirect loop (#919)
- **Calendar**: Stop emitting `RSCALE=GREGORIAN;SKIP=OMIT` on plain Gregorian recurrence rules — DAVx5 rejected them as invalid and Android sync broke (#805, thanks @hildebrandttk)

- **Pro**: Folder tabs via drag & drop
- **Pro**: The address bar follows the focused tab, and deep links are delivered live to already-mounted surfaces

## 1.8.1 (2026-08-07)

A GitHub Actions incident left the 1.8.0 release build queued indefinitely, so no Docker image was ever published for that tag. 1.8.1 re-runs the release with the same code, plus one plugin slot that merged in the meantime.

## 1.7.6 (2026-06-28)

### Breaking Changes

- **S/MIME**: The built-in S/MIME implementation has been removed from core and re-delivered through the new generic crypto plugin hooks (privileged same-origin plugin tier). S/MIME signing, encryption, decryption, certificate management, and the related settings UI now live in a plugin rather than the main app. Deployments that relied on built-in S/MIME must install the S/MIME crypto plugin to retain those features.

### Features

- **Plugins**: Privileged same-origin plugin tier with a crypto API surface
- **Plugins**: Plugin hooks for email details, headers, and source
- **Mail**: Option to hide the total message count on folders (#498)

### Fixes

- **Mail**: Hide the server scheduled folder when the virtual one is shown (#495)
- **Mail**: Stop the unified mailbox from mutating client-returned email objects
- **Composer**: HTML-escape sender and subject in the reply/forward quote header (#482)
- **Calendar**: Send calendar invites by setting `organizerCalendarAddress`
- **Identity**: Sync the default identity (`preferredPrimaryId`) to server settings (#507)
- **Auth**: Support MFA login via the structured auth endpoint
- **Admin**: Show all built-in themes in the admin theme controls (#496)
- **i18n**: Add missing translation keys across 19 locales

## 1.7.5 (2026-06-24)

### Features

## 1.7.0 (2026-05-21)

> **New: Pro mode (experimental).** Opt-in tabbed multi-pane interface for power users. Open multiple mail, calendar, contacts, and file views side-by-side, drag tabs to reorder or split panes at the edges, and work across all logged-in accounts in one shell - cross-account email moves, a unified inbox with search, account-split calendar/contacts/files sidebars, and a per-account "From" dropdown in the composer. Enable from Settings → Appearance; the `proInterface` preference is per-device and not synced.

### Breaking Changes

- **Plugins**: Plugins now run inside a null-origin iframe sandbox and talk to the host over a postMessage RPC bridge. The in-process plugin runtime is gone; the bundled in-tree plugins have been migrated. Third-party plugins built against the old in-process API need to be ported to the sandboxed runtime.
- **Plugins**: Server-managed bundles must be Ed25519-signed by the host and approved by an admin before they load. The host public key is served from `/api/plugin-signing-pubkey` and each bundle response carries the signature in the `X-Bundle-Signature` header. User-uploaded bundles still load unsigned, but managed marketplace and dev-folder bundles do not.
- **Plugins**: `bundleHash` is now a full SHA-256 over the bundle. Legacy short hashes are migrated on first load; any out-of-band tooling that pinned the old hash format needs to be updated.

### Features

- **Pro**: Tabbed shell with drag-to-reorder, drag-to-edge to split, side-by-side panes, and pane-aware responsive layout with a scoped sidebar overlay
- **Pro**: Auto-redirect to the Pro shell when Pro mode is on; `proInterface` is kept per-device instead of syncing
- **Pro**: Multi-account mail sidebar with client routing and a per-account mailbox cache
- **Pro**: Unified mailbox always visible, with full-text search
- **Pro**: Cross-account email moves
- **Pro**: Multi-account calendar sidebar split into owned vs shared per account

- **Pro**: Composer From dropdown grouped by account
- **Plugins**: Per-plugin admin approval workflow with Ed25519 bundle signing verified on load

## 1.6.4 (2026-05-11)

### Web Setup Wizard

First-launch web setup wizard. New installs no longer need to hand-edit `.env.local` - point a browser at the container and the wizard probes the JMAP server(s), configures OAuth/OIDC, generates the session secret, accepts branding uploads, and provisions the initial admin password.

## 1.5.3 (2026-04-28)

> **New:** Help shape Bulwark Webmail. Each instance now sends a lightweight daily heartbeat (version, platform, bucketed account counts, feature toggles - never message data or PII) so we can see which platforms and features actually get used and prioritize fixes where they matter most. You're in control: opt out any time from **Admin → Telemetry** or by setting `BULWARK_TELEMETRY=off`. Full schema in the [privacy notice](https://bulwarkmail.org/docs/legal/privacy/telemetry).

### Features

- **Telemetry**: Anonymous instance telemetry, on by default. Reports schema version, platform, bucketed account counts, and feature toggles only - disable from the admin UI, with `BULWARK_TELEMETRY=off`, or by clearing the endpoint
- **Telemetry**: Track unique logins (HMAC'd per instance, 90-day retention) so the heartbeat can report bucketed account totals without storing usernames
- **Plugins**: Theme API v2 with token compiler and skin slot
- **Plugins**: Extension preview page and detailed extension info API
- **Calendar**: Right-click context menu on empty calendar space
- **Docker**: Persistent named volume for telemetry data so the instance id and admin's consent choice survive container upgrades

### Fixes

- **Security**: Block telemetry endpoint from pointing at internal/loopback hosts (validation + DNS-rebind re-check at fetch time)
- **Security**: Harden plugin config, TOTP token exchange, and branding file serving
- **Mail**: Batch shortcuts now act on the multi-selection when one is present (#228)

- **Plugins**: New `composer-sidebar` slot and `ui:composer-sidebar` permission - plugins can now render a panel on either side of the New Message dialog. See `repos/subway-surfers` for an example
- **Plugins**: Manifests can declare `frameOrigins` - a strictly-validated list of `https://host` origins the plugin needs to embed. The proxy reads the union from enabled plugins and merges it into the host CSP `frame-src`, so the host CSP no longer needs to know about specific embed providers

## 1.5.0 (2026-04-22)

### Breaking Changes

- **Self-service portal now needs Stalwart 0.16+**: Stalwart dropped its self-service HTTP API in 0.16.0 and replaced it with JMAP. Bulwark Webmail only talks to the new JMAP endpoint, so the self-service portal (account settings, app passwords, API keys) requires Stalwart 0.16 or newer. `STALWART_API_URL` is deprecated, these actions go through the normal JMAP session.

### Features

- **Stalwart**: Migrate Stalwart management API to JMAP `x:` methods for Stalwart 0.16
- **Admin**: Add API Keys management and IP allowlist for App Passwords
- **Contacts**: Revamp contact detail view with filters, photo, print, and duplicate actions
- **Contacts**: Add contact activity component showing recent emails and upcoming events
- **Contacts**: Add right-click context menu
- **Contacts**: Group contacts by first letter with sticky section headers, toggleable in settings
- **Calendar**: Support resizing events from the top edge
- **Calendar**: Add timezone-aware formatting for event start times and update `utcEnd` on duration change
- **Calendar**: Optimize layout of overlapping events
- **Calendar**: Add collapsible details to calendar invitation banner
- **Email**: Implement batch archiving and bulk moving of emails
- **Email**: Show full folder path in move/drop toast
- **Settings**: Reorganize settings into 6 groups with clearer tabs
- **Navigation**: Add account-addition button to the navigation rail
- **Mobile**: Streamline email viewer header layout
- **Mobile**: Pass `isMobile` through calendar views and time-grid interactions

### Fixes

- **Mailbox**: Retry mailbox fetch on first login to handle lazy provisioning (#217)
- **Mailbox**: Use fresh state in archive handling to avoid stale mailbox data
- **Mailbox**: Improve error message on mailbox creation failure
- **Auth**: Skip `checkAuth` on route change when already authenticated
- **Auth**: Clean up unused imports and improve TOTP QR code rendering
- **UI**: Align hover styles and selection-toggle target with focused item
- **UI**: Read `matchMedia` synchronously on client to prevent layout flicker

### Refactor

- **Settings**: Remove Stalwart API URL configuration (now derived via JMAP)

### Chore

- **Deps**: Bump dependencies to latest compatible versions
